Wumbo Ideas
-----------
Creators:
Jonathan Francisco, Juan Gonzalez, Anthony Watanabe

Services used:
Used Maven to package our project together, Amazon Web Service (AWS) servers to deploy,
Amazon Relation Database System (RDS) for the database, Jenkins to update and deploy pushed code, and
Github to share code. 

Overview: 
Wumbo Ideas was created in response to the growing problem of lack of collaboration. The idea stemmed 
from groups being able to meet togethor and come up with ideas on a whiteboard. 

Implementation:
What we did was created a virtual whiteboard that users can use to collaborate their different ideas for their
different groups. We also added a todo list for users to manage their invdividual tasks that they have 
complete. A database holds the accounts for each user, and the accounts are tied to the users email accounts.

How to use:
First type wumboideas.space into your web browser. 
In the login page, sign into your account (if you don't have an account click Register account).
Once signed in you will see a whiteboard that you can edit with a to do list under. 
Then Collaborate, innovate, and come up with bigger and better ideas to push the boundaries of tech!
